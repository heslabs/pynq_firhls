Hierarchies
-----------
filter               : pynq.overlay.DefaultHierarchy

Interrupts
----------
None

GPIO Outputs
------------
None

Memories
------------
PSDDR                : Memory
Class docstring:
This class keeps track of a single bitstream's state and contents.

The overlay class holds the state of the bitstream and enables run-time
protection of bindings.

Our definition of overlay is: "post-bitstream configurable design".
Hence, this class must expose configurability through content discovery
and runtime protection.

The overlay class exposes the IP and hierarchies as attributes in the
overlay. If no other drivers are available the `DefaultIP` is constructed
for IP cores at top level and `DefaultHierarchy` for any hierarchies that
contain addressable IP. Custom drivers can be bound to IP and hierarchies
by subclassing `DefaultIP` and `DefaultHierarchy`. See the help entries
for those class for more details.

This class stores four dictionaries: IP, GPIO, interrupt controller
and interrupt pin dictionaries.

Each entry of the IP dictionary is a mapping:
'name' -> {phys_addr, addr_range, type, config, state}, where
name (str) is the key of the entry.
phys_addr (int) is the physical address of the IP.
addr_range (int) is the address range of the IP.
type (str) is the type of the IP.
config (dict) is a dictionary of the configuration parameters.
state (str) is the state information about the IP.

Each entry of the GPIO dictionary is a mapping:
'name' -> {pin, state}, where
name (str) is the key of the entry.
pin (int) is the user index of the GPIO, starting from 0.
state (str) is the state information about the GPIO.

Each entry in the interrupt controller dictionary is a mapping:
'name' -> {parent, index}, where
name (str) is the name of the interrupt controller.
parent (str) is the name of the parent controller or '' if attached
directly to the PS.
index (int) is the index of the interrupt attached to.

Each entry in the interrupt pin dictionary is a mapping:
'name' -> {controller, index}, where
name (str) is the name of the pin.
controller (str) is the name of the interrupt controller.
index (int) is the line index.

Attributes
----------
bitfile_name : str
    The absolute path of the bitstream.
dtbo : str
    The absolute path of the dtbo file for the full bitstream.
ip_dict : dict
    All the addressable IPs from PS. Key is the name of the IP; value is
    a dictionary mapping the physical address, address range, IP type,
    parameters, registers, and the state associated with that IP:
    {str: {'phys_addr' : int, 'addr_range' : int,                'type' : str, 'parameters' : dict, 'registers': dict,                'state' : str}}.
gpio_dict : dict
    All the GPIO pins controlled by PS. Key is the name of the GPIO pin;
    value is a dictionary mapping user index (starting from 0),
    and the state associated with that GPIO pin:
    {str: {'index' : int, 'state' : str}}.
interrupt_controllers : dict
    All AXI interrupt controllers in the system attached to
    a PS interrupt line. Key is the name of the controller;
    value is a dictionary mapping parent interrupt controller and the
    line index of this interrupt:
    {str: {'parent': str, 'index' : int}}.
    The PS is the root of the hierarchy and is unnamed.
interrupt_pins : dict
    All pins in the design attached to an interrupt controller.
    Key is the name of the pin; value is a dictionary
    mapping the interrupt controller and the line index used:
    {str: {'controller' : str, 'index' : int}}.
pr_dict : dict
    Dictionary mapping from the name of the partial-reconfigurable
    hierarchical blocks to the loaded partial bitstreams:
    {str: {'loaded': str, 'dtbo': str}}.
device : pynq.Device
    The device that the overlay is loaded on
Init docstring: 
Return a new Overlay object.

An overlay instantiates a bitstream object as a member initially.

Parameters
----------
bitfile_name : str
    The bitstream name or absolute path as a string.
dtbo : str
    The dtbo file name or absolute path as a string.
download : bool
    Whether the overlay should be downloaded.
ignore_version : bool
    Indicate whether or not to ignore the driver versions.
device : pynq.Device
    Device on which to load the Overlay. Defaults to
    pynq.Device.active_device
gen_cache: bool
    if true generates a pickeled cache of the metadata

Note
----
This class requires a HWH file to be next to bitstream file
with same name (e.g. `base.bit` and `base.hwh`).
